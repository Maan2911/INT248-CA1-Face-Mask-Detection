# INT248-CA1-Face-Mask-Detection


About this Dataset

Face Mask Detection Data set
In recent trend in world wide Lockdowns due to COVID19 outbreak, as Face Mask is became mandatory for everyone while roaming outside, approach of Deep Learning for Detecting Faces With and Without mask were a good trendy practice. Here I have created a model that detects face mask trained on 7553 images with 3 color channels (RGB).
On Custom CNN architecture Model training accuracy reached 94% and Validation accuracy 96%.
Mask Classifier

Coronavirus has now become the talk of the town, Like most people in the world right now are suffering badly and everyday thousand's of people are dying because of COVID-19, Iâ€™m genuinely concerned about them. So, Instead of sitting idle and let negative thoughts grow day by day,I decided to do what I do best .In the above project i used webscrapped data with classes people wearing mask and no mask and trained a resent 50. then i used the model to predict on a webcam feed

Installation:

All the required installation are mentioned in the requirements.txt

Usage:

Step 1:training the model with the appropriate data with training.ipynb, downloading the model weights.

Step 2:add the model weight in label.py program and execute it.

Step 3:finally run webcam.py, the webcam output gets saved as out.mp4.
